    o A Flight Sergeant who participates in the Music Division.
    o 3 Cadets that participate in the Music Division.

In the music division, there will be cadets that play one of these instruments:
    o A snare drum
    
The cadets will be organized like this:
         O    <-- Flight Commander
         O    <-- Flight Sergeant
      O O O O <-- Drums/percussion
      
Performances:
    The squadron will choose when to make performances. 
    For example, when there is an honor guard parade, the music division could walk in front of them and play a song.
    This would then get signed off by the f\light sergeant.

Participants in the Flight will all recieve a CMP ribbon after participating for at least 6 moths and participating in at least 1 performance.
